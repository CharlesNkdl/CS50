sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:Less time in sorted50000 than any other so omega = n , and much more time in reversed or random

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: All time are shorter than the other methods, and almost equal and since merge is theta = n log n i think this is it

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: All time are quite slow but mostly the same so theta = n2
